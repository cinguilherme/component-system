## Presentation: Component Systems in JS world

### Leveraging Typescript and ClojureScript

### Full steam ahead with immutability and functional programing paradigm

### Envisioning systems allowing for complex integration tests without heavy (expensive setups, slow execution) price and issuing assumptions on top of Deltas from actions on system


#### Imagination in visual


#### Systems as maps of components and their dependencies with managed life cycles

#### Components treated as interfaces and their implementations as functions (or objects) that can be swapped out eg. Integration tests using an implementation of http_out that does not reach to the world.
